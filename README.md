# Migrating from CodeCommit

Here's a small bash script to make moving from CodeCommit to a new Source Control provider simple.
I've also tried to provide some sanity checks and warnings as part of the script to help ensure the smoothest transition possible.
There's still manual steps that will have to be done (mostly involving communicating with other users of the repo).
Additionally you can pass the bash script to users and have them omit the final argument and answer "yes" to the replacement step. Doing so should result in their origin being updated to the one you've provided.
